According to our analysis, the highest sugar value is `r max_sugars` g and the lowest sugar value is `r min_sugars` g. The cereals with `r max_sugars` g of sugars are: `r max_row_name_piped`. Here is the summary information on sugars:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(summary_piped)
```

### Here are all the cereals sorted by sugar content:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(sugar_vals_piped)
